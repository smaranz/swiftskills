# Dynamic Type & Typography Mastery

Elite kerning, tracking, and scaleable UI. Apple-native typography schema.


## 🚀 Rork-Max Quality Snippet


```swift
Text("Rork Premium")
    .font(.system(size: 32, weight: .black, design: .rounded))
    .tracking(-0.5)
    .foregroundStyle(.primary.gradient)
```


## 💎 Elite Implementation Tips

- Scale: Always test with 'Extra Extra Large' Dynamic Type.\n- Hierarchy: Use .foregroundStyle(.secondary) instead of lower opacity.\n- Aesthetics: .rounded design + .bold weight creates an 'app-like' feel.


## Core Principles

1. **Native Polish**: Always prioritize system-standard feel (springs, materials, haptics) before custom art.
2. **Visual Depth**: Use Z-axis hierarchy (shadows, blurs) to guide user focus.
3. **Responsiveness**: Every touch and state change MUST have an immediate, physical response.
