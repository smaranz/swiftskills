# Particle Systems for Delight

Glitter, celebration, and feedback particles using high-performance emitters.


## 🚀 Rork-Max Quality Snippet


```swift
Canvas { context, size in
    // Render particles
    context.fill(Path(CGRect(x: 50, y: 50, width: 4, height: 4)), with: .color(.yellow))
}
```


## 💎 Elite Implementation Tips

- Optimization: Limit to 50 particles max for high-end feel.\n- Variance: Randomize size, velocity, and rotation slightly.\n- Gravity: Apply a gentle downward acceleration (y += 0.1).


## Core Principles

1. **Native Polish**: Always prioritize system-standard feel (springs, materials, haptics) before custom art.
2. **Visual Depth**: Use Z-axis hierarchy (shadows, blurs) to guide user focus.
3. **Responsiveness**: Every touch and state change MUST have an immediate, physical response.
