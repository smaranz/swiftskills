# Color Theory And Palettes

Mastering color relationships, avoiding generic colors, utilizing HSL, and creating harmonious, modern palettes that evoke a premium feel.

## Core Principles

1. **Aesthetics First**: The user must be wowed. Do not settle for basic styling.
2. **Modern Implementation**: Rely on modern APIs (Custom Properties, Grid, Flexbox, modern units).
3. **Consistency**: Ensure patterns are applied uniformly across the entire project.

## Implementation Guide

- Start by defining design tokens (variables) before hardcoding values.
- Build from the component level up, ensuring this skill is isolated to relevant UI elements.
- Test variations across different themes (light/dark) if applicable.
