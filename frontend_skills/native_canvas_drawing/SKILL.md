# Native Canvas Drawing

Complexity through direct shape manipulation. High-performance 2D drawing with SwiftUI Canvas.


## 🚀 Rork-Max Quality Snippet


```swift
Canvas { context, size in
    context.stroke(Path(ellipseIn: CGRect(origin: .zero, size: size)), with: .color(.blue), lineWidth: 2)
}
```


## 💎 Elite Implementation Tips

- Performance: Use Canvas for complex shapes that update at 120Hz.\n- Resolution: Draw paths using normalized coordinates to scale perfectly.\n- Filters: Leverage .blur and .colorMatrix in the Canvas context.


## Core Principles

1. **Native Polish**: Always prioritize system-standard feel (springs, materials, haptics) before custom art.
2. **Visual Depth**: Use Z-axis hierarchy (shadows, blurs) to guide user focus.
3. **Responsiveness**: Every touch and state change MUST have an immediate, physical response.
