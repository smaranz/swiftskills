# Skeleton & Perceived Performance

High-end data loading aesthetics. Using animated shimmer gradients and placeholders.


## 🚀 Rork-Max Quality Snippet


```swift
RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: 12)
    .fill(.gray.opacity(0.1))
    .overlay(
        LinearGradient(colors: [.clear, .white.opacity(0.2), .clear], startPoint: .leading, endPoint: .trailing)
            .offset(x: -100 + phase * 200)
    )
```


## 💎 Elite Implementation Tips

- Animation: Linear shine animations at 1.5s duration feel 'just right'.\n- Colors: Use the system theme so skeleton matches dark/light mode.\n- Stagger: Offset row animation start times for an organic feel.


## Core Principles

1. **Native Polish**: Always prioritize system-standard feel (springs, materials, haptics) before custom art.
2. **Visual Depth**: Use Z-axis hierarchy (shadows, blurs) to guide user focus.
3. **Responsiveness**: Every touch and state change MUST have an immediate, physical response.
