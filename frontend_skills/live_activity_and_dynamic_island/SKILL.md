# Live Activity & Dynamic Island

Designing for real-time presence. Mastering ActivityKit and Island regions.


## 🚀 Rork-Max Quality Snippet


```swift
DynamicIsland {
    expanded {
        DynamicIslandExpandedRegion(.leading) { Text("Status") }
    }
    compactLeading { Text("L") }
    compactTrailing { Text("T") }
}
```


## 💎 Elite Implementation Tips

- Content: Avoid heavy text—use icons and progress bars.\n- Update: Only update when state changes significant (>10%).\n- Animation: Transitions are handled by system—keep layouts flexible.


## Core Principles

1. **Native Polish**: Always prioritize system-standard feel (springs, materials, haptics) before custom art.
2. **Visual Depth**: Use Z-axis hierarchy (shadows, blurs) to guide user focus.
3. **Responsiveness**: Every touch and state change MUST have an immediate, physical response.
