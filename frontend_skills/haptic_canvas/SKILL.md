# Haptic Canvas

Sensory-integrated feedback. Using CoreHaptics and ImpactGenerators for tactile delight.


## 🚀 Rork-Max Quality Snippet


```swift
// Use UIImpactFeedbackGenerator for tactile delight
func triggerEliteHaptic() {
    let generator = UIImpactFeedbackGenerator(style: .rigid)
    generator.prepare()
    generator.impactOccurred(intensity: 0.8)
}
```


## 💎 Elite Implementation Tips

- Subtlety: Use .soft and .light patterns for frequent interactions to avoid fatigue.\n- Sync: Align haptic triggers with the exact peak of a fluid animation.\n- Context: Use .rigid for physical boundaries and .selection for scrolling increments.


## Core Principles

1. **Native Polish**: Always prioritize system-standard feel (springs, materials, haptics) before custom art.
2. **Visual Depth**: Use Z-axis hierarchy (shadows, blurs) to guide user focus.
3. **Responsiveness**: Every touch and state change MUST have an immediate, physical response.
