# Card Geometry & Soft Depth

Advanced shadows and corner-radius logic. Mastering the 'continuous' squircle aesthetic.


## 🚀 Rork-Max Quality Snippet


```swift
RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: 24, style: .continuous)
    .fill(.background)
    .shadow(color: .black.opacity(0.05), radius: 10, y: 5)
    .shadow(color: .black.opacity(0.1), radius: 30, y: 15)
```


## 💎 Elite Implementation Tips

- Layering: Use two shadows—one sharp and one diffuse for realism.\n- Shape: Always use .continuous corner style for smooth silhouettes.\n- Inner-Light: A 0.5pt white stroke on top simulates light-catching.


## Core Principles

1. **Native Polish**: Always prioritize system-standard feel (springs, materials, haptics) before custom art.
2. **Visual Depth**: Use Z-axis hierarchy (shadows, blurs) to guide user focus.
3. **Responsiveness**: Every touch and state change MUST have an immediate, physical response.
