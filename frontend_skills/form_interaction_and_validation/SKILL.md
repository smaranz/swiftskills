# Form Interaction & Validation

Floating labels with fluid, bouncy feedback and focus-state brilliance.


## 🚀 Rork-Max Quality Snippet


```swift
TextField("Label", text: $text)
    .focused($isFocused)
    .animation(.spring(response: 0.3), value: isFocused)
```


## 💎 Elite Implementation Tips

- Feedback: Shake the text field on invalid input using offsets.\n- Focus: Use .ultraThinMaterial behind focused fields to highlight them.\n- Keyboard: Add 'Done' or 'Next' button to the keyboard toolbar.


## Core Principles

1. **Native Polish**: Always prioritize system-standard feel (springs, materials, haptics) before custom art.
2. **Visual Depth**: Use Z-axis hierarchy (shadows, blurs) to guide user focus.
3. **Responsiveness**: Every touch and state change MUST have an immediate, physical response.
