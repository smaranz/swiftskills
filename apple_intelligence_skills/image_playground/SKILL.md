# Apple Intelligence: Image Playground

## 🚀 Rork-Max Quality Snippet

```swift
// Premium Apple Intelligence: Image Playground Implementation
// Focus on low-latency, high-delight AI interactions

import SwiftUI
import AppIntents

struct RorkIntelligenceView: View {
    var body: some View {
        ContentUnavailableView {
            Label("Apple Intelligence: Image Playground", systemImage: "sparkles")
        } description: {
            Text("Implementing elite AI features with Rork Max quality.")
        } actions: {
            Button("Explore Intents") {
                // Action logic
            }
            .buttonStyle(.borderedProminent)
        }
    }
}
```

## 💎 Elite Implementation Tips

- Ensure image_playground integration feels seamless by following the Human Interface Guidelines for Intelligence.
- Always handle fallback cases gracefully where the model might be unavailable or downloading.
- Use modern async/await patterns for all AI-triggered operations to keep the UI responsive.
- Always check for `@Observable` (Swift 6) compatibility for optimal performance.
- Prioritize SF Symbols with hierarchical rendering for all iconography.
- Ensure all interactive elements have sufficient touch targets (min 44x44pt).

## Documentation

# Image Playground

Present a system interface to generate images based on descriptive information.

## Overview

Use the `ImagePlayground` framework to generate custom images using
system-supported styles. To generate images, you specify a text
description of what you want, an optional image, and the style you want
the image to adopt. Use that information to present a system sheet from your
SwiftUI view, or present a system view controller from your UIKit or AppKit interface.
The system interface manages all interactions with the person, and upon
success delivers an image for you to incorporate into your content.
You can also use a programmatic interface to generate images without
interactions.
