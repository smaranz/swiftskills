# MACOS App and Environment

Learn about the objects that you use to interact with the system.

## 🚀 Rork-Max Quality Snippet

```swift
import AppKit

class RorkWindowController: NSWindowController {
    convenience init() {
        let window = NSWindow(
            contentRect: NSRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: 600, height: 400),
            styleMask: [.titled, .closable, .resizable, .miniaturizable],
            backing: .buffered,
            defer: false
        )
        window.title = "App and Environment"
        window.center()
        self.init(window: window)
    }
}
```

## 💎 Elite Implementation Tips

- Follow the MACOS Human Interface Guidelines for native feel.
- Use system-standard AppKit components before building custom ones.
- Support Dynamic Type and accessibility features from the start.
- Always check for `@Observable` (Swift 6) compatibility for optimal performance.
- Prioritize SF Symbols with hierarchical rendering for all iconography.
- Ensure all interactive elements have sufficient touch targets (min 44x44pt).

## When to Use

- Building native macOS features with AppKit
- Implementing menu bar items, dock menus, and macOS-specific UI
- Working with NSWindow, NSViewController, and AppKit patterns

## Best Practices

- Support keyboard shortcuts and menu bar commands for every major action
- Use NSToolbar for window-level controls; avoid floating toolbars
- Support trackpad gestures and the Magic Mouse for natural interactions

## Common Pitfalls

- Ignoring the menu bar — macOS users expect all actions available via menus
- Not testing with multiple windows open simultaneously
- Forgetting to handle the app running without any windows (macOS apps don't quit on last window close)

## Key APIs

### Life Cycle

| API | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| `NSApplication` | An object that manages an app’s main event loop and resources used by all of that app’s objects. |
| `NSRunningApplication` | An object that can manipulate and provide information for a single instance of an app. |
| `NSApplicationDelegate` | A set of methods that manage your app’s life cycle and its interaction with common system services. |
| `NSApplicationMain` | Called by the main function to create and run the application. |
| `NSApplicationMain(_:_:)` | Called by the main function to create and run the application. |

### Environment

| API | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| `NSWorkspace` | A workspace that can launch other apps and perform a variety of file-handling services. |
| `NSWorkspace.OpenConfiguration` | The configuration options for opening URLs or launching apps. |
| `NSAppKitVersion` | Constants for determining which version of AppKit is available. |

### Handoff

| API | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| `NSUserActivityRestoring` | A protocol that marks classes to restore the state of your app to continue a user activity. |

### App Services

| API | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| `NSSharingService` | An object that facilitates the sharing of content with social media services, or with apps like Mail or Safari. |
| `NSSharingServicePicker` | A list of sharing services that the user can choose from. |
| `NSPreviewRepresentableActivityItem` | An interface you adopt in custom objects that you want to share using the macOS share sheet. |
| `NSSharingServicePickerToolbarItem` | A toolbar item that displays the macOS share sheet. |
| `NSServicesMenuRequestor` | A set of methods that support interaction with items users can share through a sharing service. |
| `NSCloudSharingServiceDelegate` | A set of methods for responding to the life cycle events of the cloud-sharing service. |
| `Services Functions` | Configure the contents of your app’s Services menu. |

### App Help

| API | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| `NSHelpManager` | An object for displaying online help for an app. |
| `NSUserInterfaceItemSearching` | A set of methods an app can implement to provide Spotlight for Help for its own custom help data. |

### Errors

| API | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| `AppKit Errors` | These constants represent errors generated by AppKit. |
