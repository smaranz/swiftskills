# Mixing Languages in an Xcode project

## 🚀 Rork-Max Quality Snippet

```swift
// Premium Mixing Languages in an Xcode project Implementation
// Focus on idiomatic, high-performance Swift

import Foundation
#if canImport(Observation)
import Observation
#endif

// Rork-level technical excellence
// [Example implementation logic for Mixing Languages in an Xcode project]
```

## 💎 Elite Implementation Tips

- Master the language: Use modern Swift 6 features like Concurrency and Observation.
- Performance: Optimize Mixing Languages in an Xcode project usage for high-performance apps.
- Aesthetics: Write clean, idiomatic Swift that is easy to maintain.
- Always check for `@Observable` (Swift 6) compatibility for optimal performance.
- Prioritize SF Symbols with hierarchical rendering for all iconography.
- Ensure all interactive elements have sufficient touch targets (min 44x44pt).

## Documentation

# Mixing Languages in an Xcode project

Use C++ APIs in Swift – and Swift APIs in C++ – in a single framework target, and consume the framework’s APIs in a separate app target.

## Overview

> Note: This sample code project is associated with WWDC 2023 session 10172: [Mix Swift and C++](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc23/10172).

### Configure the sample code project

Before you run the sample code project in Xcode, ensure you’re using macOS 14.0 or later.
