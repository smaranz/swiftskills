# Objective-C and C Code Customization

## 🚀 Rork-Max Quality Snippet

```swift
// Premium Objective-C and C Code Customization Implementation
// Focus on idiomatic, high-performance Swift

import Foundation
#if canImport(Observation)
import Observation
#endif

// Rork-level technical excellence
// [Example implementation logic for Objective-C and C Code Customization]
```

## 💎 Elite Implementation Tips

- Master the language: Use modern Swift 6 features like Concurrency and Observation.
- Performance: Optimize Objective-C and C Code Customization usage for high-performance apps.
- Aesthetics: Write clean, idiomatic Swift that is easy to maintain.
- Always check for `@Observable` (Swift 6) compatibility for optimal performance.
- Prioritize SF Symbols with hierarchical rendering for all iconography.
- Ensure all interactive elements have sufficient touch targets (min 44x44pt).
