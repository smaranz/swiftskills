# Imported C and Objective-C APIs

Use native Swift syntax to interoperate with types and functions in C and Objective-C.

## Overview

You can access and use pieces of code written in C and Objective-C from within your
Swift code. After you import an Objective-C framework, a C library, or a header file,
you can work with Objective-C classes and protocols, as well as common C constructs,
functions, and patterns.

## Topics

### Swift and Objective-C in the Same Project

Access your Swift code from within your Objective-C codebase, and your Objective-C
code from Swift.
