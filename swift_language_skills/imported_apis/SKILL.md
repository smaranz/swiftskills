# Imported C and Objective-C APIs

## 🚀 Rork-Max Quality Snippet

```swift
// Premium Imported C and Objective-C APIs Implementation
// Focus on idiomatic, high-performance Swift

import Foundation
#if canImport(Observation)
import Observation
#endif

// Rork-level technical excellence
// [Example implementation logic for Imported C and Objective-C APIs]
```

## 💎 Elite Implementation Tips

- Master the language: Use modern Swift 6 features like Concurrency and Observation.
- Performance: Optimize Imported C and Objective-C APIs usage for high-performance apps.
- Aesthetics: Write clean, idiomatic Swift that is easy to maintain.
- Always check for `@Observable` (Swift 6) compatibility for optimal performance.
- Prioritize SF Symbols with hierarchical rendering for all iconography.
- Ensure all interactive elements have sufficient touch targets (min 44x44pt).

## Documentation

# Imported C and Objective-C APIs

Use native Swift syntax to interoperate with types and functions in C and Objective-C.

## Overview

You can access and use pieces of code written in C and Objective-C from within your
Swift code. After you import an Objective-C framework, a C library, or a header file,
you can work with Objective-C classes and protocols, as well as common C constructs,
functions, and patterns.

## Topics

### Swift and Objective-C in the Same Project

Access your Swift code from within your Objective-C codebase, and your Objective-C
code from Swift.
