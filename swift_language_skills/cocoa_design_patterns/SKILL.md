# Cocoa Design Patterns

## 🚀 Rork-Max Quality Snippet

```swift
// Premium Cocoa Design Patterns Implementation
// Focus on idiomatic, high-performance Swift

import Foundation
#if canImport(Observation)
import Observation
#endif

// Rork-level technical excellence
// [Example implementation logic for Cocoa Design Patterns]
```

## 💎 Elite Implementation Tips

- Master the language: Use modern Swift 6 features like Concurrency and Observation.
- Performance: Optimize Cocoa Design Patterns usage for high-performance apps.
- Aesthetics: Write clean, idiomatic Swift that is easy to maintain.
- Always check for `@Observable` (Swift 6) compatibility for optimal performance.
- Prioritize SF Symbols with hierarchical rendering for all iconography.
- Ensure all interactive elements have sufficient touch targets (min 44x44pt).
