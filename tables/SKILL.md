# Tables

Display selectable, sortable data arranged in rows and columns.
Use a table to display multiple values across a collection of elements.
Each element in the collection appears in a different row of the table, while
each value for a given element appears in a different column. Narrow displays
may adapt to show only the first column of the table.
When you create a table, you provide a collection of elements, and then tell
the table how to find the needed value for each column. In simple cases,
SwiftUI infers the element for each row, but you can also specify the row
elements explicitly in more complex scenarios. With a small amount of
additional configuration, you can also make the items in the table selectable,
and the columns sortable.
Like a `List`, a table includes implicit vertical scrolling that you can
configure using the view modifiers described in Scroll views.
For design guidance, see
in the Human Interface Guidelines.


## 🚀 Rork-Max Quality Snippet

```swift
import SwiftUI

struct EmployeeTable: View {
    @State private var employees = Employee.samples
    @State private var sortOrder = [KeyPathComparator(\Employee.name)]
    @State private var selection = Set<Employee.ID>()

    var body: some View {
        Table(employees, selection: $selection, sortOrder: $sortOrder) {
            TableColumn("Name", value: \.name)
            TableColumn("Department", value: \.department)
            TableColumn("Role", value: \.role)
        }
        .onChange(of: sortOrder) { _, newOrder in
            employees.sort(using: newOrder)
        }
    }
}
```

## 💎 Elite Implementation Tips

- `Table` is primarily for macOS/iPadOS — on iPhone it collapses to the first column
- Use `TableColumn` with `value:` key paths for automatic sorting support
- Support `selection:` binding for single or multi-row selection


## When to Use

- Arranging views in stacks, grids, or custom layout containers
- Building responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes
- Creating scrollable lists, tables, or collection-style interfaces
- Implementing custom layout algorithms with the `Layout` protocol

## Best Practices

- Use `LazyVStack`/`LazyHStack` inside `ScrollView` for large data sets
- Prefer `Grid` (iOS 16+) over nested stacks for tabular 2D layouts
- Use `ViewThatFits` to automatically choose between layout variants
- Apply `.frame(maxWidth: .infinity)` for full-width sections rather than hard-coding widths

## Common Pitfalls

- Putting `LazyVStack` without a `ScrollView` — it won't scroll
- Using `List` when you want custom styling — `LazyVStack` gives more control
- Nesting `ScrollView`s in the same axis causes confusing scroll behavior
- Forgetting `.listRowInsets(EdgeInsets())` when you want edge-to-edge list content

## Key APIs

| `tableStyle(_:)` | Sets the style for tables within this view. |

### Creating columns

| API | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| `TableColumn` | A column that displays a view for each row in a table. |
| `TableColumnContent` | A type used to represent columns within a table. |

### Creating rows

| API | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| `TableRow` | A row that represents a data value in a table. |
| `TableRowContent` | A type used to represent table rows. |
| `TableHeaderRowContent` | A table row that displays a single view instead of columned content. |
| `TupleTableRowContent` | A type of table column content that creates table rows created from a |

### Adding progressive disclosure

| API | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| `DisclosureTableRow` | A kind of table row that shows or hides additional rows based on the state |
| `TableOutlineGroupContent` | An opaque table row type created by a table’s hierarchical initializers. |
